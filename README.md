### Objective
<img src="https://after-school-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/jerry-mcguire.gif" width="300px" align="right" hspace="10"> We're going to build a `BankAccount` class where two instances of the class can transfer money to another class through a `Transfer` class. The `Transfer` class acts as a space for a transaction between two instances of the bank account class. Think of it this way: you can't just transfer money to another account without the bank running checks first. `Transfer` will do all of this, as well as check the validity of the accounts before the transaction occurs. `Transfer` should be able to reject a transaction if the accounts aren't valid or if the sender doesn't have the money.

Transfers start out in a "pending" state. They can be executed and go to a "complete" state. They can also go to a "rejected" state. A completed transfer can also be reversed and go into a "reversed" state.

### Instructions

Pass the tests. They are deliberatively vague; your design is up to you.
